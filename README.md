# Master-Profile

## Overview:
    To create a master version of the portfolio website. The idea is to design the website based off my personal direction and interest, while using various technologies. I wanted to do this without using a template so that I could learn more about the languages used. 

    This page will evolve as technologies are learned and concepts are strengthened. Projects will also be updated and linked as they are created and completed. Some projects will also be updated and the portfolio will reflect this information.

# Future:

    This portfolio isn't complete yet. Here's what I'll be updating/creating in the future:
        - Page transitions to create a greater user experience.
        - Blog: this will be something I will be incorporating in the future. 
        - Gallery page for my photography.
