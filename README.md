# Master-Profile

## Overview:
    To create a master version of the portfolio website. The idea is to design the website based off my personal direction and interest, while using various technologies. I wanted to do this without using a template so that I could learn more about the languages used.

#Future:

    This portfolio isn't complete yet. Here's what I'll be updating/creating in the future:
        - Page transitions to create a greater user experience.
        - I'd like the "Enter Vehicle" link to bring the user to a shifter style menu before entering the content of the site.
            - Also make animation so a "shifter" moves to the selected menu.
        - Portfolio Page: update it so that it's no longer a card style portfolio page. I'd like to utilize each "window" as a portfolio example with description of each project and a larger screenshot. Then a link to the git and project.
        - About Me: I'd like to list my skills/interests/languages below my paragraph. I'd stick with the overall theme of my page (automotive).
        - Blog: this will be something i will be incorporating in the future. For now, I'll put a screenshot/coming soon image/logo. 
        - I haven't reformated/updated my resume, so i haven't included it. This is on my "fast-followers" list.
        - Colors: I'd like to also update the background, header and footer colors. This will most likely happen as i go and add different elements.
