# Master-Profile

## Overview:
    To create a master version of the portfolio website. The idea is to design the website based off my personal direction and interest, while using various technologies. I wanted to do this without using a template so that I could learn more about the languages used.

        - Blog: this will be something i will be incorporating in the future. For now, I'll put a screenshot/coming soon image/logo.
